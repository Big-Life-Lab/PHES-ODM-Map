"Ottawa-1","Delatolla Group - University of Ottawa","The Delatolla Research group is based at the University of Ottawa. Our research focuses on the application of wastewater-based surveillance as an early warning system for future pandemic preparedness and the implementation of wastewater-based surveillance to improve health equity in Canada and globally. Our research group is also currently interested in advancing the detection and quantification of biological targets of population and public health importance in waters and wastewaters. We have particular interest in developing protocols and best practices to translate water and wastewater derived biological target data into population and public health action. In addition, our group performs research to leverage modern analytical methods to advance our understanding of wastewater technologies and to optimize wastewater treatment technologies to protect natural waters.","delatollaOttawa","Ottawa-1","academ",NA,"research",2024-02-05,NA
